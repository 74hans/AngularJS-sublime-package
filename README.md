AngularJS attributes completion for Sublime Text 2 and 3
=======

Details
-------
This plug-in allows for auto-completion of core AngularJS attributes within HTML elements.
You can also extend this plug-in with your own custom attributes that you've created by
adding them to the `extended_attribute_list` property in the User settings.

If you wish, you can also override the `core_attribute_list` by setting that property
within the User settings as well.
